It does so by considering the context in which speeches are made, and the content of those speeches. To detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method, based on two layers of matrix factorization. This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP has evolved significantly over time, is impacted upon by the committee structure of the Parliament, and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis have a significant impact on what is being discussed in Parliament.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Cross","given":"James P."}],"container-title":"arXiv:1505.07302 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7,7]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Unveiling the Political Agenda of the European Parliament Plenary: A Topical Analysis","title-short":"Unveiling the Political Agenda of the European Parliament Plenary","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302"},

This study analyses the national media discourses in Hungary, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Spain for this time period. Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling in five languages and based on N = 130,042 articles from 24 news outlets, we reveal country-specific media frames to track the overall course of the refugee debate and to uncover dynamics and shifts in discourses. While results show similarities across countries, due to media coverage responding to real-world developments, there are differences in media framing as well. Possible sources of these differences such as countries’ geographic location or status as receiving country are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Heidenreich","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Lind","given":"Fabienne"},{"family":"Eberl","given":"Jakob-Moritz"},{"family":"Boomgaarden","given":"Hajo G"}],"container-title":"Journal of Refugee Studies","DOI":"10/ggjbnw","ISSN":"0951-6328, 1471-6925","issue":"Special_Issue_1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"i172-i182","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Media Framing Dynamics of the ‘European Refugee Crisis’: A Comparative Topic Modelling Approach","title-short":"Media Framing Dynamics of the ‘European Refugee Crisis’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jrs/article/32/Special_Issue_1/i172/5688809","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"luo:RisePopulistRightwing.2017","abstract":"The 2014 European Parliament (EP) election resulted in the rise of populist right-wing parties (PRPs). This paper aims to answer: why PRPs were able to rise in the 2014 EP election; what messages were delivered by the election results regarding European integration; and whether or not policy-makers addressed the messages correctly with the right policy responses? After examining the competing interpretations, this paper argues that a deep disillusionment and crisis of trust in the political establishment, which derived from the long neglect of deteriorating distributional justice and fairness in European integration, which became acute after the euro crisis mismanagement, explains the 2014 EP election results. This paper, accordingly, argues that policy redirection of EU economic governance and the addressing of a ‘social Europe’ are required to regain political trust. After assessing the policy responses taken by the EU, an economic Europe is expected to revive, but the required social Europe will still remain absent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Chih-Mei"}],"container-title":"European Review","container-title-short":"European Review","DOI":"10/ggxkgg","ISSN":"1062-7987, 1474-0575","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"language":"en","page":"406-422","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Rise of Populist Right-wing Parties in the 2014 European Parliament: Election and Implications for European Integration","title-short":"The Rise of Populist Right-wing Parties in the 2014 European Parliament","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1062798717000126/type/journal_article","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"maAnatomyfundedresearch.2015","abstract":"Seeking research funding is an essential part of academic life. Funded projects are primarily collaborative in nature through internal and external partnerships, but what role does funding play in the formulation of these partnerships? Here, by examining over 43,000 scientific projects funded over the past three decades by one of the major government research agencies in the world, we characterize how the funding landscape has changed and its impacts on the underlying collaboration networks across different scales. We observed rising inequality in the distribution of funding and that its effect was most noticeable at the institutional level—the leading universities diversified their collaborations and increasingly became the knowledge brokers in the collaboration network. Furthermore, it emerged that these leading universities formed a rich club (i.e., a cohesive core through their close ties) and this reliance among them seemed to be a determining factor for their research success, with the elites in the core overattracting resources but also rewarding in terms of both research breadth and depth. Our results reveal how collaboration networks organize in response to external driving forces, which can have major ramifications on future research strategy and government policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Athen"},{"family":"Mondragón","given":"Raúl J."},{"family":"Latora","given":"Vito"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10/f74bwd","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"48","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"14760-14765","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Anatomy of funded research in science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1513651112","volume":"112"},

This includes an overview of the different approaches to framing in political communication research, more specifically, and of the relationship between framing and related effects models, such as priming and agenda setting. The authors conclude with a recommendation that framing research be redirected away from confounded “emphasis frames” toward “equivalence frames” in the original tradition by expanding the sample of potential frames to include nonverbal visual cues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheufele","given":"Dietram A."},{"family":"Iyengar","given":"Shanto"}],"container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199793471.013.47","editor":[{"family":"Kenski","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Jamieson","given":"Kathleen Hall"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The state of framing research: A call for new directions","type":"chapter","URL":"http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199793471.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199793471-e-47","volume":"1"},
